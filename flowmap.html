            <hr class="my-4">
            <p style="font-size:1vw;">The first part of the flow map that I would like to talk about is the choropleth base map. For this base map
            I chose the reds color scheme along with equal interval classification. I thought equal interval was the best choice for the data given. I initially 
            thought to use natural breaks but decided otherwise as I thought it didn't provide the user with an instantly intuitive map. As for the red color scheme
            with a 70% fill opacity, I thought this looked like it would be difficult for the user to misread which made it my choice. One other aspect of the base map
            was the stroke width. It was initially set to .5 but I set it to 1. I did this because not all the countries in South America are represented in the data
            and the larger stroke width helps the user differentiate between the countries we are looking at and the ones we are not looking at. When looking at the nodes,
            I chose to use three classes with blue nodes. I chose three classes because I thought it represented the data well, without overcomplicating things. As for the 
            blue color, I wanted the user to have a clear visual representation of the data and not get it confused with the base map. Since blues and greens are the oppisite
            of reds on the color wheel, I went with blues to make sure the nodes didn't get lost in the background. Lastly, when looking at the flow symbology I chose to use
            the same logic as I did with my point symbology. I utilized three classes with a blue color scheme. I also chose the half arrow style as I thought it
            provided a clear representation of what I wanted to show. One last thing to note, is that I also used a small black stroke width on my nodes and flows to make sure the 
            smaller points of data didnt fade into the background. </p>

            <h1 class="display-4 text-center" >Interpretation of Map</h1>
            <hr class="my-4">
            <p style="font-size:1vw;">By looking at this flow map, we can see that the Chile and Argentina have the have the largest
            positive different between their imports and exports(net flow). This is because they import far more than they export. This can 
            be seen when looking at the flow arrows, many of which are pointed at Chile and Argentina. Ecuador is the country that exports the 
            most bananas. We can notice this a few way. First, the choropleth map shows that Ecuador has a negative net flow. We also
            can see that many flow arrows leave Ecuador with only few returning. Lastly we can notice that the node on Ecuador is very large, telling
            us it has a large volume of total banana trade. I would also like to point out that the majority of the trade goes from north to south,
            meaning that like we said earlier, the southern countries import more than they export. Lastly, something I found very interesting
            was the fact that only Ecuador is a major supplier. Going in to this project I would have thought that it would be failry even, but we 
            can clearly see that most of the northern countries have a very low total trade volume(shown with nodes). Even though countries like
            Brazil and Bolivia have negative net trading(more exports) it was still interesting to me that There was one country in Ecuadar that 
            did so much more than the other. </p>
